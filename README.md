# 🐢 Turtle Crossing Game (Python)

A fun arcade-style Turtle Crossing (Frogger-like) game built in Python using the built-in `turtle` module.  
Control the turtle, dodge the cars, and try to reach the top of the screen. Each level gets harder as the cars move faster!

---

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries needed (uses only built-in modules: turtle, time, random)

To check if Python is installed, run:
python --version
